title: Translating the SDG DSD
---
This project serves to convert the SDG DSD into a format suitable for computer-assisted translation, and then export the resulting translations back into SDMX.

Translations can be performed [here](https://www.transifex.com/brockfanning/sdg-dsd-translations/translate/).

The latest translated SDMX DSD is available [here](dsd-exported.xml).
