title: Translating the SDG DSD
---
This project serves to convert the SDG DSD into a format suitable for computer-assisted translation, and then exported the resulting translations back into SDMX.

Translations can be performed here: TBD

The latest translated DSD is available [here](dsd-exported.xml).

Note that it will have some XML-related differences from the original,
like namespaces and indentation.
